After about 16 months of on-and-off research, our paper titled 'MoS2 quantum dots decorated MWCNTs based electrochemical sensor for dopamine in the presence of uric acid and ascorbic acid and an integration with machine learning' has been accepted by principle in Tungsten. View (this)[https://onapte.github.io/publication/mos2-quantum-dots-decorated-mwcnts-based-electrochemical-sensor-for-dopamine] link to check out the publication. I am grateful to Dr. Kiran Kumar Tadi for giving me the opportunity to work under him.


This post will be updated once the publication is up on the internet. Thank you for your patience.
