# Abstract
In terms of the contexts of devices and applications, the application execution required in cloud and fog computing systems is typically heterogeneous. The scaling of these needs on various architectures is a multi-restriction optimization problem. Despite all of our efforts, task scheduling in these systems still faces some interesting difficulties, which makes us curious in how jobs are routed between various physical devices, fog nodes, and the cloud. But there has been a lot of study done on job scheduling in cloud computing systems. However, most studies use a service providerâ€™s point of view or pursue higher application quality of service (QoS) levels while addressing this issue. This study examined the main job scheduling strategies used in cloud and fog architecture.
